#### Work

I have been a software engineer since 2000, first in France working on real-time applications in Java and C++ for the military industry at Thales Underwater Systems and moved to the Web platform around 2002-2003 because it was more fun I guess.

Since 2006 I have been living in Japan where I worked during 3 years at Samurai Factory, a Japanese web company who produced services (the [**Ninja tools**](http://ninja.co.jp)) for its then more than million users base. From February 2010 to 2015 I worked as a freelancer first mainly with the Tokyo based multimedia agency [**UltraSuperNew**](http://ultrasupernew.com) until 2013 for multiple Red Bull projects and with the design office [**AQ**](http://aqworks.com). I‚Äôve also worked on independent projects for individuals, companies, local government or NPOs.

From March 2013 to March 2014, I worked also part-time for the government of [Tottori](/tags/Tottori) Prefecture in Japan to help them to promote eco-tourism and the [**International Ecotourism Conference**](http://iec2013.daisenwonder.com/index.html?lang=en) that was organized.

From February 2015 to Mars 2016 I was an employee of [**Business Bank Group**](http://bbank.jp) working on an ERP software, [**All-In**](http://web.all-in.xyz/).

In March 2016 I resumed my freelance activites. I then worked on different projects for AQ (mainly for Google Japan) and also for Ê†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æAIDaNE notably.

In 2019, I developed a couple of Wordpress sites and implemented a Shopify store with some custom features. I also freelanced for „Ç¢„ÇØ„Çª„É´„É¶„Éã„Éê„Éº„ÇπÊ†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æ (Accel Universe) developping a Human Resources SaaS for [EN JAPAN](https://www.enjapan.com/)(08/2019~12/2019).

Moreover, from 2011 to 2020 I also was on and off the lone maintainer and developer for the Non Profit Organization http://gadago.org/ taking care of the https://TokyoArtBeat.com website and developing the API for the corresponding iOS application.

From January to May 2020 I developed an MVP for a company in Tokyo. I can't say much about it but it was a good opportunity to use again Ruby on Rails and Stimulus.js with Action Cable.

I took a break from work during mid 2020 summer when my son was born.

From August to end of November 2020 I was freelancing for [BULBÊ†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æ](https://bulbcorp.jp/) and it was a good match and so we decided I became an employee of the company, from December 2020 I was a happy employee working from home. I worked on different projects for our clients, my favorite one was for [Renewable Japan](https://www.rn-j.com/en/), a dashboard collecting data from hundreds of solar panel power plants in Japan.

In 2023 the company was acquired by [Ê†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æCoLife](https://www.colife.co.jp) to become their IT department. The field of work did not interest me much so I decided to look for a company in an area that would genuinely interest me.

In June 2024, I started to work for [Mnes / „Ç®„É†„Éç„Çπ](https://mnes.life).

My linkedin post about it :[Mnes announcement](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jeromesadou_%E3%83%88%E3%83%83%E3%83%97%E3%83%9A%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B8-%E6%A0%AA%E5%BC%8F%E4%BC%9A%E7%A4%BE%E3%82%A8%E3%83%A0%E3%83%8D%E3%82%B9-mnes-inc-activity-7239929056773713921-D9fc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

I can work in French, English and Japanese. My work covers these platforms:

\- Web, back-end and front-end. I am old school I guess.  
\- Feeding iPhone / Android Web Apps. with custom APIs (also can build Native Apps. with React Native/Expo for example)  

My favorite web development framework is Ruby on Rails, wether to build website or APIs to feed some other front-end techno made. I enjoy also Hotwire/StimulusJs and the new magic brought by the people from Basecamp.
I also enjoy developing with Go / Python for the backend and ReactJs for the frontend.

If you think I could help you developing your idea, don't hesitate to contact me, I am all ears :
